    <h1 align="center">What is Dental Home Visit Care?</h1>
    <p>“The dental home is the ongoing relationship between the dentist and the patient, inclusive of all aspects of oral health care delivered in a comprehensive, continuously accessible, coordinated, and family-centered way. Establishment of a dental home begins no later than 12 months of age and includes referral to dental specialists when appropriate.”</p>
    <p>Similar to the medical home, the dental home offers the patients comprehensive, continuous, prevention-based care that is accessible, family-centered, compassionate, and culturally competent. Citing strong clinical evidence that early preventive dental care promotes oral health, the AAPD declared that “the establishment of a dental home may follow the medical home model as a cost-effective and higher quality health care alternative to emergency care situations”.[2] At the center of the PCM-DH is a trusting relationship between the patient and his/her personal provider who leads a team to address the patient's needs. Generally, this provider is a primary care physician; however, for dental care, it could be a dentist.</p>
