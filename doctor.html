            <h1>Doctor at Home</h1>
            <p>CARE at HOME is a home healthcare service provider with a difference. The core purpose is to deliver 'Healthcare outside hospitals' in the right way. The main focus is on clinical excellence coupled with superior patient experience at an affordable cost.</p>
            <h2>Family Doctor</h2>
            <p>Our family doctor visits the patient at home to review the health status, recommend diagnostics, formulate a treatment plan and refer them to a specialist, if required.

                The family doctor can suggest if a particular treatment is suitable for being given at home. They may refer the patient for home treatment whilst keeping them under supervision at all times.
                
                You can avail doctor visits for:</p>
                <li>Regular health check-ups that help identify the effectiveness of medications administered and early identification of complications. </li>
                 <li>When the patient is suffering from fever, cold, cough and other common medical conditions, the doctorâ€™s home visit will reduce the stress of visiting a hospital and waiting for a doctor consultation.</li>
                <li>Death certification</li>
